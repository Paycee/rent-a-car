# RentACar Java Project

This is a desktop Java application for managing a simple car rental system.  
The project is built using Java, with a focus on object-oriented programming and a Swing-based graphical interface.

> **Note:** This project was developed in Serbian as required — apologies to international readers!

## Features

✅ Add and manage car records  
✅ View available cars and their details  
✅ Simple user interface with message dialogs  
✅ Read/write car data from/to a text file (`cars.txt`)  
✅ Modular code with separate classes (Car, RentACar, MessageBox, Main)

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17 or higher recommended)  
- IntelliJ IDEA (project built using .iml and `.form` files)  
- Swing (for GUI forms and dialogs)

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download the project folder.**  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.  
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.  
4. Compile the project (`Build → Build Project`).  
5. Run the `Main.java` class to start the application.

> Note: Make sure `cars.txt` is present in the root directory so the app can read and update car data.

## Example Usage

To add a new car, launch the app and use the interface to enter:  
- Car brand/model  
- Year of production
- Number of days  
- Date  

The app will display messages using a custom message box (`MessageBox.java`).
